# Absinth's MPV config
My own mpv config, using vulkan api.

Made for watching anime but can be used for TV shows and movies.

## HOW TO INSTALL:

1) DROP FILES TO YOUR MPV FOLDER IN %APPDATA% (CREATE IT IF THERE IS NO MPV FOLDER)
2) Start Your mpv and you should be able to see that it works.

## Used shaders:
- SSimDownscaler (Luma downscale)
- FSRCNNX_x2_8-0-4-1 (Luma upscale)
- static luma noise
- static chroma noise

## Used scripts:
- autoload.lua
- mpv-gif.lua
- titleresolver.lua
