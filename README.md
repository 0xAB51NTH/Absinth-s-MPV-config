# Absinth's MPV config
My own mpv config, utilizing vulkan api.
Main usecase for me was watching anime but im pretty sure you can watch all sorts of videos with it :)

## HOW TO INSTALL:

1) Drop files in your "mpv" folder in %APPDATA% (CREATE IT IF THERE IS NO MPV FOLDER)
2) Start Your mpv and you should be able to see that it works.

## Used shaders:
- SSimDownscaler (Luma downscale)
- FSRCNNX_x2_8-0-4-1 (Luma upscale)
- static luma noise
- static chroma noise

## Used scripts:
- autoload.lua
- mpv-gif.lua (I like to make a gif sometimes [requires ffmpeg installed])
- titleresolver.lua
